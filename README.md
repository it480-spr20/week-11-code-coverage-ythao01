Code Coverage Lab
=================

This is another MSDN walkthrough exercise. The primary objective is to see how a modern IDE can give you code coverage information and how this can be used to guide you in adding and improving unit tests. A secondary objective is to see "live" unit testing, which runs your unit tests whenever you change your code - think of it as the IDE equivalent of live spell-checking.

Instructions
------------

 1. Go to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/live-unit-testing-intro?view=vs-2019> and read the overview, then follow the link to "Get started with Live Unit Testing in Visual Studio."
 2. Follow the instructions all the way through
 3. At the end, take a screenshot of your IDE (at step 11 of "Handle a test failure").
 4. Add the screenshot to this repo as proof that you completed the lab.
